# Votechain Full Documentation

## Inspiration Behind Votechain

Centralized voting system has led to a lot of controversies and illegal appointments in different countries all over the world. Citizens suffer for lack of secured, transparent, decentralized means of voting and appointing leaders. Even so-called independent bodies assigned to be in charge of free and fair elections aren’t independent and can be manipulated. Citizens stopped exercising their voting rights because of lack of trust and transparent means of Election and voting exercise.

Imagine a Decentralized voting system, **secured**, **stress free**, **transparent** to Citizens, winners are not selected by a body, but selected based on the number of votes verified by the Smart contract and announced automatically with **ChainLink Automation**, yes that’s Votechain.

## Problems Votechain is Solving

Votechain has been developed by the team to solving several problems in the voting system of different nations of the world, but these are some of the problems we are solving:

1. **Manual Counting and Tabulation:** Paper-based voting requires manual counting and tabulation of votes, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. The risk of miscounting or misinterpreting ballots increases, potentially leading to inaccurate results. **Votechain** Results are counted automatically by the smart contract, and with **ChainLink Automation** Winners are picked base on the highest number of votes.

2. **Ballot Design and Complexity:** Poorly designed or confusing ballots can create difficulties for voters, especially those with low literacy levels or visual impairments. Ambiguous instructions or unclear candidate choices can result in voter confusion and unintentional errors. This is the reason why we have made sure **Votechain** User Interface and User Experience is has simple and direct as possible, both on desktop and mobile.

3. **Ballot Security**: The physical handling and transportation of paper ballots raise concerns about security. Ballot boxes may be vulnerable to tampering, theft, or damage, compromising the integrity of the voting process. Imagine not having to leave the comfort of your home to perform your voting exercise all process done from a comfortable atmosphere in your home, without the thought of security etc.

4. **Voter's Verification:** Verifying the identity of voters and ensuring that each voter casts only one vote can be challenging in paper-based systems. Which is the reason we have developed a system that requires the voter's National Identity Number which is unique to each voter, and we have made sure that a National Identity Number and a wallet address can only vote once on Votechain.

5. **Lack of Transparency** : Paper-based voting systems often lack transparency and easily auditable processes, paper-based voting systems are not easy to track or audit, counters are human beings and can decide to manipulate numbers which won't be easy to track, this is the reason we have picked blockchain to be the solid foundation of the development of Votechain, all vote casted and counted can be tracked on the blockchain by the general public not just a centralized body.

6. **Votechain also addresses the issue of voter apathy.** By offering a user-friendly interface and eliminating barriers to participation, citizens are encouraged to exercise their voting rights. With a decentralized system, citizens have full control over their votes, allowing them to actively shape the future of their communities.

7. **Biased and lack of independence in electoral bodies** Votechain solve the perception of bias and lack of independence in electoral bodies responsible for organizing and overseeing elections further erodes trust in the system. Accusations of favoritism, lack of transparency, and political interference undermine the credibility of electoral bodies and raise questions about the fairness of the electoral process.

## Challenges we Encountered

- We encountered quite a lot of Challenges in the development phase of Votechain, starting from the development of the User Interface as well as the Experience, we are determined to make sure the interface is has simple for every user as possible as well as we made sure we run away from any bad experience from any of the users.

- Furthermore, we experienced some set back in the process of implementing the **ChainLink Automation** system, which is one of the strong bone of VoteChain because we decided we want the announcement of the Winners to be automated and as decentralized as possible from the contract.

- Also we experienced some difficulty in our third party technologies and this is because we don't want not having a decentralized wallet be the reason why citizens won't be able to vote which is the reason we provided as many options as possible for wallet connection with RainbowKit.

## Accomplishments we are Proud of

- One of our Accomplishments so far is the successful development of Votechain, this all started from an idea from a team, before we started the development, we are so proud of ourselves that we can showcase Votechain and preach the power of Blockchain and what decentralization can actually bring to our daily world today.

- We are so proud that, even though we encountered a lot of challenges in the development phase, some even leading to almost giving up on Votechain because we really faced some new challenges in the development phase even when the team is an experienced team, we are so happy that Votechain is live and deployed online.

- We are proud to be part of the team developing on this space and are happy has well to show case the power of decentralization through Votechain.

## What we learnt

Throughout the Hackathon period and the development phase we have been able to dive in deeper to the power of blockchain and decentralization. We have been able to learn some new technologies like the **Particle Network** for wallet connection.

- Furthermore, we learnt and also implement the ChainLink Automation and was able to activate it to its potential use in the system was was really an amazing experience.

## What's Next for Votechain

The team has a lot in store for Votechain moving forward from the hackathon and after below are some of them

1. **Implementation of Meta Transaction:** Moving forward we are planning to implement Meta Transaction into Votechain which simply means, voters won't have to pay for Gas Fees for voting again, which will further help with the user experience.

2. **Votechain goes Public:** It is part of the team's plan to make Votechain open source for the community of developers which will further widen the scope of Votechain and further enlarge our coast.

3. **Votechain goes Crosschain:** We are currently on the ETH chain and the **Sepolia Network** We are planning to go crosschain i.e be able to support other chains and networks.

## Final Remarks

The democratic process in Nigeria and several West African countries heavily relies on traditional paper-based voting systems. While these systems have served as the backbone of elections for many years, they come with significant limitations and challenges that undermine the credibility and transparency of the voting process.

In the current voting system, citizens cast their votes on paper ballots, which are manually counted by election officials. However, this manual process is susceptible to errors, manipulation, and tampering, leading to controversies and disputes over election results. Instances of ballot stuffing, vote buying, and ballot box snatching have marred the integrity of elections, creating doubts and eroding trust in the electoral process.

This centralized voting system also presents barriers to access and participation. Citizens living in remote or rural areas often struggle to reach polling stations, limiting their ability to exercise their voting rights. Additionally, physically challenged individuals and those living abroad face obstacles in participating fully in the voting process, leading to exclusion and diminished representation.

Moreover, Votechain's transparent nature ensures that every step of the voting process can be audited and verified by anyone with access to the blockchain. This level of transparency restores faith in the electoral process and holds accountable those responsible for upholding democratic principles.

In conclusion, a decentralized voting system like Votechain holds the potential to transform the way elections are conducted. By providing a secure, transparent, and citizen-centric approach to voting, it addresses the limitations of centralized systems. With Votechain, citizens can regain confidence in the democratic process, knowing that their voices are heard and their votes truly count. It's time to embrace this innovative solution and pave the way for a new era of trusted and inclusive elections.

**The Future of Votechain is so bright and we are happy to say it is in safe hands.**
